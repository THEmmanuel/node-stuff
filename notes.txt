Express js is all about middleware
Middleware means that an incoming request is funneled through a bunch of functions by express. Instead of having having just one request handler.
This allows splitting code into muultiple files

This is a core concept of express js

Static file serving means not handled by the express router or middleware but instead directly forwarded to the file system.

Node js with express adds a bunch of utility functions
Express js is a node js framework -  a package that adds a bunch of utility functions and a clear set of rules on how the app should be built

Other packages can be added middleware

Express relies on middleware functions that can be added by calling use()

Niddleware functions handle a request and should call next() to the next function or send a response

Routing to filter requests by path and method
Filter by method matches path exactly, otherwise the first segment of a URL is matched
