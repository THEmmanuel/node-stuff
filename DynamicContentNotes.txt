In real applications, we dont just return static html pages
Its common to have some data managed on the server/database

Managing data (Without a database for now)

Understanding templating engines

Templating engines
For putting dynamic content into html pages, we'll use templating engines.

How templating enhgines works
There's an HTML-ish template with a lot of html structure and markup
This includes some blanks and placeholders etc
There's also some node/express content

A templating engine that understands a certain syntax that it uses to replace placeholders or certain snippets. This is contextual
The content is generated on the fly by the templating engine, taking the dynamic content into account

The result will be a dynamic html page that's dynamic and generated on the fly

Templating engines: EJS, Pug(jade), Hanldebars

EJS short syntax: <p><%= name %></p>
Normal html and plain javascript in templates

Pug: p #{name}
Pug dosent use real html, it replaces this with a minimized version or a minimal version
minimal html and custom html template language

Handlebars: <p>{{name}}</p>
Handlebars uses real html with double curly braces to mark placeholders for dynamic content
handlebars uses Normal html and a custom language template
